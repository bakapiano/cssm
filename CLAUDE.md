# ccsm — Claude Code Session Manager

A small Node/Express + Preact web tool that runs every Claude/Codex/
Copilot CLI session inside a single web app. PTYs live in-process
(node-pty), sessions persist across restarts, and `--resume <uuid>`
reattaches to the exact upstream conversation.

## Why this exists

When you're running 8–10 concurrent `claude` sessions across ad-hoc
clones (`D:\proj`, `D:\proj2`, `…`, plus GUID worktree dirs), it's easy
to lose track of which terminal is which session. ccsm gives an
at-a-glance sidebar, organises sessions into folders, and `--resume`s
each one in the same xterm.js panel.

## Architecture: hosted frontend + local backend

The frontend is **not** bundled in the npm package — it's hosted on
GitHub Pages and matched to your installed backend version through a
version router.

```

```

**Version routing.** GH Pages root (`/ccsm/`) hosts a tiny static
router (`pages-root/index.html`) that probes `localhost:7777/api/health`
and redirects to `./<backend.version>/`. Each release publishes a fresh
`/ccsm/<X.Y.Z>/` subdir; old ones stay forever via the workflow's
`keep_files: true`. Result: a 1:1 frontend↔backend version pin, no
semver-compat logic, and old backends keep working indefinitely.

Each per-version frontend has its version baked into a `<meta
name="ccsm-frontend-version">` at deploy time (injected by the GH Pages
workflow). On boot it re-fetches `/api/health` and bounces back through
the router via `location.replace('../')` if the backend has since been
upgraded.

When the backend is offline the router itself shows a "Start ccsm" UI
with a `ccsm://start` link (same protocol-handler trick we already
register at install time). No need to redirect to a stale version.

**Dev mode.** When running from a checkout (`__dirname` not under
`node_modules`), the backend ALSO serves `public/` so contributors can
iterate at `localhost:7777/` without pushing. In dev there's no
`<meta>` tag → the version guard no-ops.

## Run

```powershell
# install once
npm install -g @bakapiano/ccsm

# then anywhere
ccsm
```

`ccsm` opens the version router in a chromeless Edge `--app=` window.
Terminal returns immediately (the server is spawned detached). Close
the window → server saves a final snapshot of state and exits within
~12s.

If you don't want the auto-opened window (e.g. you live in the PWA),
just visit `https://bakapiano.github.io/ccsm/` — when backend is
down you see the inline OfflineBanner with a **Start ccsm** button.

Default port `7777`, default workDir `~/ccsm-workspaces`. Config +
state live at `~/.ccsm/` (override with `CCSM_HOME=<path>`). All
settings editable through the Configure page
(`~/.ccsm/config.json` on disk). Notable knobs:

- `port` (default `7777`) — preferred listen port. If taken, ccsm tries `+1..+9` then asks the OS for any free port.
- `browserMode` (default `app`) — `app` finds Edge or Chrome and spawns it with `--app=<url> --user-data-dir=<DATA_DIR>/browser-profile`. `tab` opens the default browser. `none` skips opening.
- `clis` — array of CLI definitions. Built-ins for `claude`, `codex`, `copilot`; users can add `other` CLIs with custom `command`, `args`, `resumeArgs`, `resumeIdArgs`, `shell` (direct/pwsh/cmd).
- `defaultCliId` — which CLI the Launch page pre-selects.

## ccsm:// protocol · "wake on click"

The hosted frontend can't spawn processes (sandboxed). For "click to
wake backend" we register a per-user URL protocol handler on Windows:

```
HKCU\Software\Classes\ccsm\shell\open\command
  → wscript.exe "<LOCALAPPDATA>\ccsm\launcher.vbs" "%1"
```

`launcher.vbs` uses `Shell.Run(..., 0, False)` — windowstyle 0 means the
spawned `ccsm.cmd` runs **completely hidden**. No console flash. The
`.cmd` goes through `bin/ccsm.js`, which detects `ccsm://start` in argv,
spawns `server.js` detached with `CCSM_NO_BROWSER=1`, and exits.

The router's "Start ccsm" button (and OfflineBanner inside each
per-version frontend) is just `<a href="ccsm://start">`. First click
triggers a one-time Windows confirmation dialog ("Open ccsm.cmd?");
ticking "Always allow" makes it silent thereafter.

postinstall (`scripts/install.js`) registers the protocol
unconditionally on Windows — including npx-cache installs. The path
stored in the registry points at whatever `ccsm.cmd` location npm gave
us (`<prefix>/ccsm.cmd` from `npm config get prefix`).

## In-app upgrade

About page surfaces the installed version, polls
`registry.npmjs.org/@bakapiano%2Fccsm/latest` (cached 30 min) for the
latest published version, and offers an **Upgrade** button when newer.
`POST /api/upgrade` spawns `npm i -g @bakapiano/ccsm@latest` detached,
then on success spawns a fresh `ccsm` (also detached) and
gracefulShutdowns. The OfflineBanner appears briefly; the router then
picks up the new version on its next probe.

The `target` field is regex-validated (`/^[a-z0-9.+\-^~]+$/i`) before
the spawn — npm install doesn't shell out, but defends against argv
weirdness regardless. Concurrent calls return `409`.

## Lifecycle

Single `gracefulShutdown(reason)` function in `server.js` is the only
exit path. It kills any PTY children, then `process.exit(0)`. Every
trigger funnels here:

| trigger | path |
|---|---|
| auto-spawned browser window closes | `child.on('exit')` — see smart-kill below |
| `POST /api/shutdown` | from npm uninstall, from launcher's auto-upgrade |
| `POST /api/upgrade` after install completes | self-restart |
| SIGINT / SIGTERM | OS signals |
| heartbeat watchdog timeout | 90s with no heartbeat, only when launched via `bin/ccsm.js` |

**Smart browser-exit**: when the spawned browser child dies, we don't
kill immediately. Two filters:

1. **Fast-exit (<5s)** — Edge `--app=` often hands the URL off to an existing Edge profile process group and the spawned child dies milliseconds after creation. We ignore any exit inside the first 5s.
2. **Deferred multi-client check (12s)** — after a real close, wait 12s and check if any heartbeat arrived AFTER the close timestamp. If yes, a hosted-frontend tab (or another window) is keeping us busy, stay alive. If no, gracefulShutdown.

Frontend heartbeat cadence is 10s (in `main.js`), so one full cycle
fits inside the 12s decision window.

Environment overrides:
- `CCSM_KEEP_ALIVE=1` → disable both browser-exit hook and heartbeat watchdog. For automation hosts.
- `CCSM_LAUNCHER=1` → set by `bin/ccsm.js` when it spawns the server; enables the heartbeat watchdog.
- `CCSM_NO_BROWSER=1` → set by the launcher when handling a `ccsm://` click or by `/api/upgrade` self-respawn; suppresses the server's auto-open browser.
- `CCSM_NO_DEV=1` → suppress dev-mode features (static serving, hot-reload SSE) even when running from a checkout.

## Sessions: persisted, adopted, resumed

There's **one source of truth**: `~/.ccsm/sessions.json`, managed by
`lib/persistedSessions.js`. Every session ccsm starts goes in there
with `{ id, cliId, cwd, workspace, title, folderId, repos,
cliSessionId, status, … }`. We don't enumerate `~/.claude/` or walk
process trees anymore.

**`cliSessionId` pre-assignment.** Every built-in CLI (claude, codex,
copilot) gets a UUID generated by `crypto.randomUUID()` at spawn time
and stamped into the persistedSessions record up front. How the UUID
makes it into the CLI's own state depends on what the CLI exposes:

- **claude / copilot** — pass it via `--session-id <uuid>` (their
  `newSessionIdArgs` template). The CLI creates its transcript file
  under that exact UUID.
- **codex** — no equivalent flag exists. Instead, `lib/codexSeed.js`
  writes a fake rollout file at
  `~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-<ts>-<uuid>.jsonl` containing
  one `session_meta` line carrying the chosen id + spawn cwd, then we
  spawn `codex resume <uuid>` so the first launch *is* a resume
  against our seed. Codex appends real events to the same file from
  there.

Either way, no polling, no race, no 5-minute timeout. **Resume** uses
the CLI's `resumeIdArgs` template (`['--resume', '<id>']` for
claude/copilot, `['resume', '<id>']` for codex) to reattach precisely.
There is no fallback path — every ccsm-launched session has a captured
upstream id, so resume by id always applies. User-added "other" CLIs
must configure `newSessionIdArgs` + `resumeIdArgs` (or accept that
resume won't work).

For `adopt`-imported sessions the record is born with `cliSessionId`
already set (from disk scan), so resume uses `resumeIdArgs` directly.

**Adopt.** "Import existing session" on the Launch page lists
sessions found on disk (`/api/cli-sessions/:type`) and lets the user
add one to ccsm with `/api/sessions/adopt`. The created record is
born `status: 'exited'` with `cliSessionId` pre-set. Clicking it in
the sidebar runs the normal resume flow — which uses the captured id.

**Auto-resume.** SessionsPage doesn't show a "Resume" button. On
mount, if the active session's status isn't `running`, it calls
`resumeSession()`. `resumeSession()` in `api.js` keeps a per-id
in-flight Map so the same call from Sidebar.onClick and the
SessionsPage effect collapse into a single backend hit.

```

On first run, if a legacy `<repo>/data/` directory exists and `~/.ccsm/`
is empty, `lib/config.js` copies the old data over (one-time,
idempotent).

## Locked-in design decisions

**Single in-app terminal, no `wt`.** PTYs run in-process via node-pty
and stream to xterm.js over `/ws/terminal/:id`. We dropped the
`wt`-per-session, focus-by-HWND, snapshot-of-live-claudes layer
entirely — too platform-specific and the web terminal handles
everything the old path did.

**Workspace = folder holding multiple repo clones.** Each `ws-N` under
`workDir` contains a subdirectory per cloned repo. CLIs launch at the
workspace root so all selected repos are sibling folders.

**Workspace naming.** Auto-allocated names are `ws-1`, `ws-2`, …
(lowest free integer). Hand-named folders under `workDir` are still
picked up.

**Frontend trusts the backend's capability advertisement.**
`/api/capabilities` returns `{ webTerminal: true|false, ... }`. The
frontend uses ONLY features the backend says it has. Breaking changes
ship a new `/ccsm/<X.Y.Z>/` frontend; the router pins users to the
matching version.

**One source of truth for cross-origin.** `public/js/backend.js`
exports `httpBase()` and `wsBase()`. Localhost → same-origin (empty
base). Anything else → `http://localhost:7777`. CORS on the backend
allows `https://bakapiano.github.io` only — never `*`.

## API surface

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET / PUT | `/api/config` | read / replace config |
| GET | `/api/sessions` | list persisted sessions |
| PUT | `/api/sessions/:id` | rename / move to folder |
| DELETE | `/api/sessions/:id` | kill PTY + drop record |
| POST | `/api/sessions/new` | body `{cliId, cwd?, repos?, folderId?, title?}` — NDJSON stream (workspace · clone-progress · launched) |
| POST | `/api/sessions/:id/resume` | re-spawn at `cwd` with `cli.resumeIdArgs <id>` (fallback `resumeArgs`) |
| GET | `/api/cli-sessions/:type` | scan disk for unimported `claude`/`codex`/`copilot` sessions |
| POST | `/api/sessions/adopt` | body `{cliId, cliSessionId, cwd, title?, folderId?}` — create a `status:exited` record with `cliSessionId` pre-set |
| GET | `/api/folders` · POST `/api/folders` · PUT/DELETE `/api/folders/:id` · POST `/api/folders/reorder` | folder CRUD |
| GET | `/api/workspaces` | workspaces under workDir with repo clone status + in-use flag |
| GET | `/api/browse` | directory browser for the Launch page workdir picker |
| GET | `/api/version` | `{ current, latest, updateAvailable, fetchedAt, cached, error? }` (npm registry cached 30 min, `?refresh=1` to bust) |
| POST | `/api/upgrade` | body `{target?}` — `npm i -g @bakapiano/ccsm@<target>` then self-restart |
| GET | `/api/capabilities` | `{ webTerminal: bool, ... }` for frontend feature gating |
| GET | `/api/health` | `{ ok, pid, version, name }` — used by router probe + heartbeat |
| POST | `/api/heartbeat` | called every 10s by the frontend; feeds lifecycle decisions |
| POST | `/api/spawn-browser` | open another browser window into the running server (used by `bin/ccsm.js` for auto-upgrade-restart) |
| POST | `/api/shutdown` | gracefulShutdown — used by uninstall + auto-upgrade |
| WS | `/ws/terminal/:id` | xterm.js bridge to a PTY in the webTerminal pool |
| GET (dev) | `/api/dev/ping` · `/api/dev/reload` | hot-reload SSE (only when running from a checkout) |

`/api/sessions/new` streams **NDJSON** (one JSON object per line). Event
types: `workspace`, `clone-start`, `clone-progress` (phase/percent/
current/total/detail), `clone-line` (raw git stderr line when not a
progress line), `clone-end`, `launched`, `done`. The frontend reads it
with `fetch().body.getReader()` + `TextDecoder` and updates per-repo
progress bars live.

**WebSocket Origin check**: same allow-list as CORS. The upgrade handler
rejects any Origin not in `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (plus localhost/127.0.0.1).
Browsers always send Origin on WS upgrades.

## Non-obvious gotchas

**Pre-assigned UUID needs either a flag OR a writable transcript dir.**
`newSessionIdArgs` works two ways: native flag (claude, copilot via
`--session-id`) or seeded transcript file (codex via `resume <id>` +
`lib/codexSeed.js`). User-added "other" CLIs without either get no
pre-assignment and fall back to `resumeArgs` (`--continue` / equivalent)
on relaunch — they just won't have a captured upstream id.

**Adopt is atomic.** `persistedSessions.create()` accepts `status` +
`cliSessionId` so the adopt endpoint writes the record in a single
file write rather than `create({running})` + `update({exited,
cliSessionId})`. The two-write form had a window where a concurrent
GET /api/sessions could see `running` with no live PTY, fooling the
sidebar's "skip resume if running" guard.

**Auto-resume dedup is module-level in api.js.** Sidebar.onClick and
SessionsPage's effect can both fire for the same exited session in the
same tick. `resumeSession()` keeps a per-id in-flight `Map` so the
second caller awaits the first one's promise instead of issuing a
second `/resume`.

**Heartbeat watchdog only when launched.** Set via `CCSM_LAUNCHER=1` by
`bin/ccsm.js`. If you start `server.js` directly (e.g. dev), the
90-second timeout doesn't apply — convenient when stepping through
code, but you have to ctrl-c yourself when done.

**ccsm:// silent dispatch.** Direct registration of `ccsm.cmd` as the
protocol handler causes a brief console window flash (cmd hosts the
.cmd file). The wscript.exe + .vbs wrapper avoids it entirely — wscript
is a Windows-subsystem host (no console) and `Shell.Run(..., 0, False)`
launches the target hidden. The `.vbs` is generated at install time
with the correct ccsm.cmd path baked in.

**Edge --app handoff race.** When the user has an existing Edge profile
process running, `--app=URL --user-data-dir=DIR` against the same DIR
may cause the new msedge.exe to immediately exit after handing the URL
off to the existing process. Our child handle dies milliseconds after
spawn. The lifecycle hook ignores any browser-child exit inside the
first 5s for exactly this reason.

## Frontend design language

The UI deliberately copies **claude.ai's** calm light aesthetic — warm
cream surfaces, generous spacing, soft borders, **no orange highlights**.
The brand orange `#b3614a` survives only in the brand mark / wordmark
dot. Every other "highlight" use (selection, focus rings, dirty
indicators, progress bars, page-actions banner) is ink/gray.

**Palette** (CSS vars in `public/css/tokens.css`):
- `--bg`            `#faf9f5`  warm cream page background
- `--bg-elev`       `#ffffff`  card surfaces
- `--sidebar-bg`    `#faf9f5`  (same as `--bg`, single continuous surface)
- `--border`        `#e8e3d5`
- `--ink`           `#1a1815`  body text (warm near-black, also used for terminal background)
- `--ink-mid` / `--ink-muted` / `--ink-faint`
- `--accent`        `#b3614a`  desaturated terracotta — brand only
- Status: green `#4a8a4a` idle · blue `#4a73a5` busy (pulsing) · red `#b73f3f` danger

**Type**:
- Body / headings: **Geist** (Google Fonts, 300–700).
- Mono: **JetBrains Mono** for paths, PIDs, sessionIds, branch tags.
- Always `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` on numeric cells.

**Buttons**:
- `.action` (default) — white bg, ink-mid border, ink text.
- `.action.primary` — black ink bg, white text. The "do this" CTA.
- `.action.subtle` — transparent bg, light border.
- `.action.danger` — filled red bg + white text.

**Layout**:
- Sidebar (collapsible, ~232px ↔ ~60px, state in `localStorage["ccsm.sidebar-collapsed"]`)
  - brand mark + `CCSM.` wordmark
  - tabs: Sessions / Launch / Configure / About
  - folder tree of persisted sessions (drag-sortable)
- Page-title bar: title on the left, server-status pill + Refresh button on the right
- Top-right control group uses fixed `min-height: 28px` and `border-radius: 999px` so server-status + Refresh align as a coherent control row

**No emoji in the UI** unless the user typed it. Use inline SVG icons
everywhere (line stroke, 1.5–2px) so they take `currentColor`.

**PWA + WCO**:
- `display_override: ["window-controls-overlay", "standalone"]` in the manifest. When installed and launched as PWA, the title bar's middle is reclaimed; only OS controls float top-right.
- `public/css/wco.css` provides drag regions (`-webkit-app-region: drag`) on `.sidebar-brand`, `.page-head`, etc., unconditional. Interactive elements opt out via the no-drag block.
- The root PWA manifest at `pages-root/manifest.webmanifest` has stable `id: /ccsm/` so installs survive across version-router redirects to new `/ccsm/<X.Y.Z>/` subdirs.

## Versioning

The hosted frontend lives at `https://bakapiano.github.io/ccsm/`. The
deploy workflow publishes two things to gh-pages on every push to main:

1. `pages-root/` → `/` (the router, plus root PWA manifest)
2. `public/` → `/<pkg.version>/` (the per-version frontend; workflow injects `<meta name="ccsm-frontend-version">` at build time)

Old version dirs stay forever (`keep_files: true`), so a user on an
older backend keeps loading the matching frontend until they upgrade.

`bin/ccsm.js` does auto-upgrade-restart: when the user runs `ccsm` and
the installed package version differs from a running backend, it POSTs
`/api/shutdown` to the old, waits for the port to free, then spawns a
fresh server. So `npm i -g @bakapiano/ccsm@latest && ccsm` is one
seamless step. From the frontend, the About page's Upgrade button
achieves the same thing without leaving the browser.

## Cross-platform

Today: Windows-first.

Cross-platform-clean already:
- Frontend (pure web)
- Router page (pure HTML/JS)
- `bin/ccsm.js` (pure node)
- `lib/webTerminal.js` (node-pty handles platform)
- `lib/persistedSessions.js`, `lib/folders.js`, `lib/config.js`, `lib/jsonStore.js`, `lib/localCliSessions.js`, `lib/workspace.js` (fs only)
- `server.js` Express + ws

Windows-specific (need ports for Mac/Linux):
- `scripts/install.js` — uses `reg.exe` and `wscript.exe`. Mac: write `Info.plist` with `CFBundleURLTypes`. Linux: write `~/.local/share/applications/ccsm.desktop` with `MimeType=x-scheme-handler/ccsm`.
- The `--app=` browser detection and PATH-merge in `server.js` are Windows-shaped (Edge first, registry HKCU\Environment for PATH).

Pattern for adding a platform: `switch (process.platform)` at each
entry point in those files. Each platform branch is roughly 50-100
lines.

## Extending

When adding features, the natural extension points:
- **New REST routes**: `server.js` (keep under `/api/*`, use the `asyncH` wrapper, decide if it needs CORS by being in the allow-list).
- **Frontend page**: `public/js/pages/<Name>Page.js`, route in `App.js`, sidebar nav item in `Sidebar.js`, heading in `state.js`'s `TAB_HEADINGS`.
- **Persistent user data**: drop a JSON file under `~/.ccsm/` and use `lib/jsonStore.js`'s factory.
- **Different CLIs**: add a built-in to `DEFAULT_CLIS` in `lib/config.js` (set `newSessionIdArgs` if the CLI accepts a pre-assigned UUID, `resumeIdArgs` for precise resume), an icon to `public/js/icons.js`, and (if the CLI persists transcripts on disk and you want adopt support) a list helper to `lib/localCliSessions.js`.
- **A capability**: advertise via `/api/capabilities`. Frontend gates UI on `caps.<feature>`.
- **Bumping the frontend**: just `npm version <patch|minor|major>` + push. The GH Pages workflow publishes to `/<new-version>/` and the router redirects users to it.
